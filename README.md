# Structuring-a-page-of-content-MDN

My version of MDN's Assessment: Structuring a page of content.

This goal of this assignment is "to take the content for
the homepage of a bird watching website and add structural
elements to it so it can have a page layout applied to it." 
A sample image is given to show what the homepage should
look like after being marked up.
